Description:
	This add-on reads the text on your anki cards during review aloud, using your default Microsoft text-to-speech voice.
	It does not function on Mac or Linux for this reason.

	You can make it read cards in different languages and voices. (see FAQ below.)

  How do I get more Voices? / How do I change the Language?
	1. Open Settings.
	2. Search "Add Speech Voices".
	3. Notes:
	   - You will see "Choose a voice", "Voice speed", and "Preview voice" here.
	    - THESE ARE SEPARATE FROM THE VOICES/SETTINGS THIS ADD-ON USES.
 	     - Changing these settings will do nothing! They do not matter!
 	      - The voice selection under "Choose a voice" lists many voices, but few can be used for this add-on.
 	       - Do not expect to be able to use as many voices as in that list.
	4. Click "Add Voices".
	5. Pick the language you want the voice to speak in.
	   - There are multiple options for English; I recommend "English (United Kingdom)" for intelligibility.
	6. Close Settings.
	7. Reopen Control Panel and view the voice selection options.
	8. Any new voices that can be used will show up there.

Don't download "microsoft voice packs" from the internet. 
	Downloading random gunkware puts you at risk for a few things like, trojans, ransomware, rootkits, spyware, adware, worms, 		keyloggers, botnets, backdoors, fileless malware, and scareware. 
	These are everywhere on the internet, even in "Trusted Sources" or websites that say they "scan" their files for viruses.
	If you download gunk, you will get these.
